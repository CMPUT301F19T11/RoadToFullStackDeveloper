# GroupMeeting3    - Wednesday, October 16

## Goal:
Everyone has almost done their individual work. However, our work has not been integrated yet and 
there are many details we want to discuss and improve.
Today's meeting is giving us a chance to work together instead of discussing.

## The thing we want to improve:

- The backlog is lack of rationale.
- Mockups are lack of color.
- Storyboard is not clear enough.
- We need more standards. (eg: the color for different emotional state, RGBA value for different color .etc)
