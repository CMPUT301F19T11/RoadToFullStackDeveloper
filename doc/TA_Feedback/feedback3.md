Here is some quick feedback which you can address by Friday.

1. Make sure your Story Board reflects your current application status (you can use screenshots)  
2. and make sure that all your user stories are covered in at least 1 test case.

I will probably provide more written feedback with the mark breakdown for part 3 but that won't be something you need to worry about by the deadline of part 4.
