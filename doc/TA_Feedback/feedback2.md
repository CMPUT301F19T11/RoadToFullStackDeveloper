Product Backlog
- Overall: Good.
- You cover all the requirements, however, I don't follow some of your rationale for particular user stories. Some rationale points do not seem to be specified under the right user story.

User Interface Mockups / Storyboard Sequences
- Overall: Excellent. 
- I found the matching of emoticons with moods a bit unclear in your mockups. Maybe you could add a brief explanation next to the corresponding UI frames?

Object-Oriented Analysis
- Overall: Good. 
- There are some relationships your UML diagram does not cover, such as those between different users on following/follower lists.
- If you are using String types as placeholders for attributes such as the location, make sure that this is updated once you have decided on a design for the type of these attributes.
- Methods with the same name but different purpose  such as getFollowing() in User class and FollowingList class could be confusing. Try renaming one of them to better reflect its purpose.
- Please add some more descriptions/explanations to briefly describe the classes.

Glossary and Information Sources
- Overall: Excellent.

Tool Practices
- Overall: Excellent.

Overall I think it is looking good so far. Good luck on part 3.
