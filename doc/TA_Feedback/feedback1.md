## Thursday, October 17, the day before project2 due date

**For the backlog part:**
- The rationale part is fine.
- Our story form should contains the content of user needs. (Copy them from description page)
- We donâ€™t cover all user needs in the problem description. (There are 16 in total, we have 15)
  
  
**For the user story part:**
- An idea: If we clicked the bubble, we can go to another page. This page can display details of the mood event.
- Upload original picture to wiki page.(Higher Resolution)



**For the UML part:**
- Add multiplicity (1-1).
- Thinking carefully about aggregation and composition.
- The model should cover all of user needs.


**For the glossary Part:**
- Looks fine.

**Others:**
- DO NOT make any change after due date
- We do not need to submit anything on eclass page, TA will check our wiki page.
